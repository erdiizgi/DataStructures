## [Fibonacci Heap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_heap).
## [Priority Queue](https://erdiizgi.com/data-structure-for-games-priority-queue-for-unity-in-c).

This library planned to be used to create a highly efficent data structure for games. It will evolve as long as I keep continue to write blog posts about data structures.
